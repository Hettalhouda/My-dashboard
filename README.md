 MyDashboard – Personal Productivity Dashboard

This is a personal productivity dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It includes useful widgets like:

- 🗓️ Mini calendar with current date and time  
- ✅ To-Do List with `localStorage` support  
- 🧢 Daily Hats (daily tasks tracker with live counter)  
- 📖 Quick reading suggestion  
- 📅 Historical fact of the day  
- 💡 Technical tip of the day

   📌 Why I Built This

As a front-end developer in training, I wanted to build a simple but useful dashboard that combines multiple small tools I personally use — like a to-do list, a calendar, and daily inspiration — all in one place.

This project was created to:
- Practice modern HTML/CSS/JS
- Learn to use `localStorage`
- Build reusable and accessible UI components
- Publish my first static site on GitHub Pages 🎉
